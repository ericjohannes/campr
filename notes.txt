followed this to get started with github actions and lambda: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-github-actions-to-deploy-serverless-applications/

road map to convert to github aws sam, lambda function
1. init sam in this repo
2. look at how to store secrets in aws, store secrets for sendgrid in aws https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/how-to-use-aws-secret-manager-and-ses-with-aws-sam-a93bb359d45a 
3. move python functions to python file that runs on lambda
4. update requirements.txt to include what I have in pipfile
5. make python script trigger based on lambda triggers

notes on steps
1. ran ` sam init -r python3.10 -n sam-campr --app-template "hello-world"`
hello world app works when i do a local invoke of that function

3. moved python into app and it's working! had to instlal python3.10 locally
not set up to email yet bc of secrets
4. this is done too, had to to make my script work inside the app

2. stored secret in aws, tried ot add it. addings stuff to requirements.txt to handle secrets
fixed a bug in accessing actual secret
had to add permissions to lambda function's role to read secret

5. steps: 
"add trigger"
"eventbridge (cloudwatch events)"
"create a new rule"
sked expression: cron(3 4,10,16,22 * * ? *)
