followed this to get started with github actions and lambda: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-github-actions-to-deploy-serverless-applications/

road map to convert to github aws sam, lambda function
1. init sam in this repo
2. look at how to store secrets in aws, store secrets for sendgrid in aws
3. move python functions to python file that runs on lambda
4. update requirements.txt to include what I have in pipfile
5. make python script trigger based on lambda triggers
